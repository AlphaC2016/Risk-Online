                "Risk" is a strategy game built for 2-6 players, in which the player has only one goal - 
                conquer the entire world!
            
                HOW DOES IT WORK?

                PRE-GAME
                Every players starts with an army, and a few territories that belong to him.
                In total, there are 42 territories, and every player gets an equal amount.
                At the start of each game, the player must divide his army between his terriroties -
                the compuiter automatically puts one soldier in each territory (the minimum.)

                when you finish stationing all your soliders, the real game begins!

                TURN PROCESS
                The game works in turns.
                each turn begins with reinforcments - the player gets a few more soliders to put in his territories.
                for every three territories you have, you get one soldier for your reinforcments -
                with three soldiers as a minimum. additional bonuses will be detailed later.

                in each turn, a player can use the force he has in a certain territory to attack
                territories that are "connected" to it - either by land or by naval connection.
                
                BATTLES
                when one territory battles another, each one brings a few soldiers to fight.
                the attacker can bring up to 3 soldiers, and the defender can bring up to 2.
                if you are the attacker, you must leave at least  one soldier at the home territory at all times -
                if you have 3 soldiers, you can only send 2, etc.
                
                for each soldier you bring, you get a die. when the dice are thrown,
                it is decided who will lse how many soldiers.
                how do we do that?
                the attacker compares his highest score to the defender's highest score.
                if the attacker's die got a higher one than the defender's, the defender loses one soldier.
                if the numbers are equal, or the defender got a bigger score, the attacker loses one soldier.
                EXAMPLE:
                the left numbers are the attacker, the right one are the defender.
                6 - 5
                5 - 5
                3
                because 6 > 5, the defender loses one soldier.
                but because 5=5, the attacker also loses one.
                a battle ends when all defende units are dead, when there is only one attacker soldier left,
                or when the attacker retreats.
                if a battle was successful, the attacker must put at least one unit in the new territory.
                a player's turn ends when he doesnt want to attack any more.

                at the end of each turn, the player can move forces from one territory to another,
                as long as they are connected - if by normal connections or a chain of his territories.


                BONUSES
                if a player captures a whole continent, he gets a reinforcment bonus for as long as he has the entire
                continent under his control.
                the continent - bonus table is the following:

                Australia - 2
                S. America - 2
                Africa - 3
                N. America - 5
                Europe - 5
                Asia - 7


                That's it for now.
                Good luck!
